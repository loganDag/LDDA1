## Welcome to LDDA1 Repository!

### About

You may be asking, "What does LDDA1mean?". It means Logan Dag Dev Android App 1, just no extra "A". This app will be my first attempt at making in an app in "Kotlin", I have made apps in the past in Java.

This app will mainly be a small app in order to learn the new development of Android and to see where it can go. It will have no "real" purpose, more of a testing and debugging/praticing app.

I would like to see the following for it:

- [ ] Camera capturing
 - [ ] Notification testing
 - [ ] Firebase intergration for databases
 - [ ] Network state cpature
  - And really anything else that might be small.
